        Amar Desh 'My country'; listen is a daily newspaper in Bangladesh, published from Dhaka in the Bengali language since 2004.[4] Amar Desh provides news about Bangladesh from local and regional perspectives and covers international news. Amar Desh is considered as a popular newspaper in Bangladesh.[5][6] The newspaper was closed down in 2010 and again in 2013 by the Awami League administration.[7][6] After the fall of Hasina's regime, the newspaper was relaunched in 22 December 2024.

        <h3>Shut down and relaunch</h3>
        <p>
            The Awami League government has shut down Amar Desh twice, both times coinciding with the arrest of its editor, Mahmudur Rahman, and imposed censorship on the newspaper. On June 1, 2010, the editor was arrested, and the government temporarily closed the newspaper for 10 days. On April 11, 2013, Rahman was arrested again after Amar Desh published leaked Skype conversations between the Chief Justice of Bangladeshâ€™s war crimes tribunal and Ahmed Ziauddin, leading to further suppression of the newspaper. Then government authority closed this newspaper.
